                  <p><strong>Loan Referral Service</strong></p>
                  <p></p><p>Our loan referral service (the “Service”) connects consumers with prospective lenders participating in our network (the “Lender Partners”). To use the Service, you must complete an online request form (a “Request Form”) that requests personal information from you, including your name, address, telephone number, email address, social security number, bank account information, and employment information. Our collection and use of this information is subject to the Website’s Privacy Policy, which is incorporated into these Terms.
                  </p>
                   <p><strong>Credit Decisions</strong></p>
                 <p>fundingwood.com is not a lender and does not make loans or credit decisions. fundingwood.com does not guarantee that any Lender Partner will offer you a loan or that any loan offer will contain any specific loan terms or conditions. fundingwood.com does not guarantee that the price, product, availability, rates, fees, or any other loan terms offered and made available by Lender Partners through the Service are the best terms available in the market.</p>
                 <p>Once you submit a Request Form, fundingwood.com shares your information with our Lender Partners. By submitting a Request Form, you understand and agree that you requesting loan offers from the Lender Partners. You are also agreeing that fundingwood.com and the Lender Partners may contact you by any means (including email, telephone, SMS, and direct mail) so that they may assist in processing your Request Form or provide information to you about additional offers now or in the future.</p>
                  <p>Lender Partners who receive your Request Form review your information in real-time to determine whether your information meets the Lender Partner’s underwriting criteria. Lender Partners may use your Request Form information to perform a credit check. This credit check may be a formal credit inquiry which leaves a record on your credit report and may affect your credit score (a “Hard Check”). Or it could be an informal inquiry which will not affect your credit (a “Soft Check”). These credit checks may be performed through TransUnion, Equifax, or Experian (the “Big Three”) or they may be performed through other alternative credit reporting agencies or data aggregators (such as Microbilt, Teletrack, DP Bureau, or DataX) that track consumer transactions with lending institutions. By submitting your Request Form, you agree to allow Lender Partners to review, verify, and research your information in such a manner.                </p>
                 <p>If a Lender Partner determines that your Request Form meets its underwriting criteria, your browser will be redirected to the lender’s website. You understand and agree that, once you have been redirected to the lender’s website, fundingwood.com has no further involvement in the loan registration or decision process. Your interactions with the lender are subject to privacy policy, terms of use, and other policies or terms enforced by that lender.</p>
                  <p><strong>Electronic Disclosure</strong></p>
                <p>By Submitting your Request Form you agree to receive notifications, disclosures, and other documents and communications both from fundingwood.com and from our Lender Partners. If you are connected to a Lender Partner, that lender may require you to execute an electronic loan contract. This electronic loan contract will be as binding as a loan contract in paper form. And your electronic signature will be as valid as a physical signature on a paper loan contract.</p>
                  <p>The lender may also require you to consent to receiving all notifications regarding your loan electronically. These electronic communications may include attempts to collect a debt.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, the lender may require you to access documents related to a loan, including your loan contract. By Submitting your Request Form you agree to this form of access.</p>
                  <p>The lender may allow you to withdraw your consent to electronic disclosures. Please contact the lender with whom you were connected to learn more about this process. Please note, however, that not consenting to receive electronic disclosures may affect your ability to receive a loan from a Lender Partner.</p>
                   <p><strong>Accuracy</strong></p>
                   <p>You represent that the information you provide to fundingwood.com, and ultimately, the Lender Partners, through your Request Form is accurate and truthful. If the information in your Request Form is not accurate and truthful, fundingwood.com may deny, suspend, or terminate your use of the Service.</p>
                  <p><strong>Control over Features, Functions, and Access to the Service</strong></p>
                   <p>fundingwood.com may change any information, features, or functions of the Service without prior notice. fundingwood.com may deny you access to all or part of the Service without prior notice if you engage in any conduct or activities that fundingwood.com determines, in its sole discretion, violate these Terms, the rights of fundingwood.com or any third party, or is otherwise inappropriate. fundingwood.com is not responsible for any errors or delays in providing Service caused by errors in the Request Form information provided by you or by any technical problems beyond its reasonable control.</p>
                 <p><strong>Disclaimers and Limitations</strong></p>
<p>
  The website and the information, software, products, and services associated with it are provided “as is.” fundingwood.Com expressly disclaims any warranty of any kind, whether express or implied, as to any matter whatsoever relating to the website and any information, software, products, or services provided herein, including without limitation the warranties of title, non-infringement, merchantability, or fitness for a particular purpose.

<p>fundingwood.Com or the lender partners or advertisers or any of their officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, successors, assigns, content providers, or service providers will not be liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, special, or punitive damages or other injury arising out of or in any way connected with the use of the website or the service or with the delay or inability to use the website, or for any information, software, products, or services obtained through the website, or otherwise arising out of the use of the website, whether resulting in whole or in part, from breach of contract, tortious behavior, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, even if fundingwood.Com or the lender partners have been advised of the possibility of damages.
</p>
<p>fundingwood.Com does not endorse or recommend the products of any particular lender. fundingwood.Com is not an agent of you or any participating lender. fundingwood.Com is not involved with the lender’s use or review of your request form information or in making a determination about whether you meet a particular lender’s underwriting criteria.

</p><p>
Some states do not allow the limitation of liability and disclaimer of implied warranties, so the disclaimers and limitations above may not apply to you. In such states, the respective liability of fundingwood.Com, the lender partners, and their officers, directors, agents, subsidiaries, affiliates, employees, successors, assigns, content providers and service providers is limited to the greatest extent permitted by law.
</p>
<p><strong>indemnity</strong></p>

<p>as a condition of using the website or the services, you agree to indemnify fundingwood.Com and the lender partners from and against any and all liabilities, expenses (including attorney’s fees) and damages arising out of claims resulting from your use of the website, including any claims alleging facts that if true would constitute a breach by you of these terms.

<p>
Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to the use of the website, to the use of the service, or to any acts or omission for which you may contend fundingwood.Com is liable (a “dispute”), will be settled exclusively by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the american arbitration association in effect at that time. The arbitration will be conducted in los angeles, california and judgment on the arbitration award may be entered into any court of competent jurisdiction. No arbitrator will have the power to award damages in connection with any dispute in excess of actual compensatory damages and will not multiply actual damages or award consequential, punitive, or exemplary damages, and each party irrevocably waives any claim thereto. The agreement to arbitrate will not be construed as an agreement to the joinder or consolidation of an arbitration under this agreement with an arbitration of disputes or claims of any non-party, regardless of the nature of the issues of disputes involved.
