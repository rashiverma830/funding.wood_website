        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4> Deletion Request Rights </h4>
    <p> You have the right to request that fundingwood, LLC delete any of your Personal Information that we collected from you and retained, subject to certain exceptions. Once we receive and confirm your verifiable consumer request (see Exercising Access, Data Portability, and Deletion Rights), we will delete (and direct our affiliates to delete) your Personal Information from our records, unless an exception applies. </p>

      <li> Engage in public or peer-reviewed scientific, historical, or statistical research in the public interest that adheres to all other applicable ethics and privacy laws, when the information's deletion may likely render impossible or seriously impair the research's achievement, but only if you previously provided informed consent. </li>

      <li> Make other internal and lawful uses of that information that are compatible with the context in which you provided it. </li>

    <p> To exercise the access, data portability, and deletion rights described above, please submit a verifiable consumer request to us by either: </p>
    <ul class="ulclass">
      
      <li> Sending us mail to: 1309 Coffeen Avenue Ste 1200, Sheridan County, WY 82801, United States </li>
      <li> Only you, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that you authorize to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must: </p>
    <ul class="ulclass">
      <li> Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative. Please include your first and last name, email address, and physical address. </li>
      <li> Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it. </li>
    </ul>
    <p> We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot fully verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you. </p>
    <p> Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. However, we do consider requests made through your password protected account sufficiently verified when the request relates to Personal Information associated with that specific account. </p>
    <p> We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request. </p>
    <h4> Response Timing and Format </h4>
    <p> We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within forty-five (45) days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to an additional ninety (90) days), we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. </p>
    <p> We will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option. </p>
    <p> Any disclosures we provide will only cover the twelve (12)-month period preceding the verifiable consumer request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable. </p>
    <p> If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request. </p>
